# IT Project - IoT System for Supermarket 🛒

**Mar 2025 - Apr 2025**
*University group project – 1st year, 2nd semester*

This project consists of an IoT system for monitoring and controlling sensors and actuators in a supermarket environment. It was developed using a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, a responsive website and a simple API for real-time interaction.

The aim is to apply IoT concepts, web development, and data management without a database, using files for storage.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Raspberry Pi 5
* Esp32 Dev Kit
* PHP (without frameworks)
* HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Bootstrap for responsive design)
* File system for data storage (TXT)
* JSON for communication via REST API

## 📄 Features

* Sensor reading: temperature, humidity, and ultrasonic sensor
* Actuator control: fan, servo motor, LEDs
* Responsive web dashboard for real-time visualization and control
* Data history stored in .txt files
* Simple authentication system for dashboard access
* API for communication between the frontend and sensors/actuators

## 📦 Installation

To run the project locally on a Raspberry Pi with a web server and PHP:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DuarteLacerda/ti25.git
cd ti25
```
